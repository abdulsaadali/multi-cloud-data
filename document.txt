Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a modern technology that allows users to access and store data, applications, and services over the internet instead of using a local computer or server. It provides a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to use computing resources without the need to own and maintain physical infrastructure.

With cloud computing, users can access files, run software, host websites, store large amounts of data, and even use artificial intelligence tools — all through the internet. These services are provided by cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Cloud computing is based on a simple idea: you only use what you need, when you need it — similar to how we use electricity or water. It supports different models, such as:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): renting servers and storage

PaaS (Platform as a Service): building and deploying apps without worrying about the hardware

SaaS (Software as a Service): using applications like Gmail, Zoom, or Office 365 over the internet
